    <h3>Our Commitment to Fairness</h3>
    <p>
      ResuMetric AI is designed to reduce unconscious bias by focusing strictly on 
      <strong>Weighted Skill Logic</strong> and <strong>Experience Relevance</strong>. 
      Our algorithms do not use protected characteristics to influence candidate rankings.
    </p>
    <h3>How Scoring Works</h3>
    <p>
      Candidates are evaluated based on a breakdown of Skills (60%), Experience (20%), 
      and Education (10%). This objective approach ensures that the 
      best-fit talent rises to the top of your pipeline.
